# SpatialXomics

English | [简体中文](README.md)

SpatialXomics is a web platform for mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) data management and analysis. The Vue 3, TypeScript, and Vite frontend supports imzML upload, public/private dataset management, configurable preprocessing, Zarr result visualization, annotation matching, ROIs, and region comparison.

## Main Features

- **Authentication and authorization**: sign-in, registration, password recovery, profiles, administrator user management, and protected routes.
- **Dataset management**: browse public datasets, manage personal datasets, inspect metadata, share public overview pages, and download raw `.imzML` / `.ibd` pairs.
- **Upload pipeline**: MD5 in a Web Worker, server-side reuse checks, ZIP64 compression into OPFS, Alibaba Cloud OSS multipart upload, and same-browser resume.
- **Analysis workspace**: compatible noise reduction, baseline correction, normalization, peak picking, and peak alignment choices based on spectrum/storage mode.
- **Result visualization**: Continuous ion images and mean spectra; Processed TIC images and per-pixel spectra; display range, gamma, colormap, TIC normalization, and transparent PNG export.
- **Clustering and regions**: backend-generated UMAP plus browser-local KMeans, cluster filtering, rectangular/freehand ROIs, and multi-region comparison.
- **Annotations**: CSV import for Continuous + Centroid results, m/z matching in ppm or Da, filtering, export, and PubChem lookup.

## Local Development

### Requirements

- Node.js `^20.19.0` or `>=22.12.0`
- npm (the repository commits `package-lock.json`)

### Install

```bash
npm ci
```

### Environment

The repository already contains:

- `env/.env` for shared values such as `VITE_API_BASE` and `VITE_OSS_ENDPOINT`.
- `env/.env.development` for the development proxy target `VITE_BACKEND_URL`.
- `env/.env.production` for production build/preview values.

Put machine-specific overrides in the ignored `env/.env.development.local`:

```bash
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

In development, Vite proxies `/api` to `VITE_BACKEND_URL`. In the production container, nginx proxies `/api/` to the runtime `BACKEND_HOST:BACKEND_PORT` values.

### Run

```bash
npm run dev       # SPA (5173) and docs (5174)
npm run dev:app   # SPA only
```

### Build and Verify

```bash
npm run build             # type-check + SPA build to dist/
npm run check             # type-check + ESLint + unit tests
npm run test:unit:run     # one-shot unit tests
npm run test:e2e          # Playwright E2E
npm run docs:build        # docs build to dist-docs/
npm run icons:bundle      # regenerate the offline icon subset
```

`npm run format` formats `src/` only; Markdown files are maintained separately.

## Runtime Configuration

The application loads `public/config.json` before mounting Vue. It controls the app name, navigation, pagination, verification, and Zarr read tuning. A missing or invalid file produces a startup error page.

Home page content (hero copy, feature showcase, timeline, team, contact details, commit heatmap) lives in `public/content.json` and is fetched only when the home route is entered; if it cannot be loaded the home page simply omits those sections. Both files can be edited on a deployed server and take effect on reload.

Form dropdown vocabularies and ion-source requirement rules are no longer JSON — they are compiled into the bundle (`src/features/datasets/constants/datasetMetadata.ts`, `src/features/upload/utils/ionSourceRules.ts`) and require a rebuild to change.

## Documentation and Deployment

- User and contributor docs live under `docs/` and are served locally at `http://localhost:5174/docs/`.
- The Docker image contains both `dist/` and `dist-docs/`; nginx serves the SPA and `/docs/` separately.
- The `test` branch runs checks, the docs build, and three-browser Playwright tests. `dev` and `main` trigger their respective deployments.

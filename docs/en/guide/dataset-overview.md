## Metadata Sections

The detail page is organized into three sections.

| Field | Example | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Organism** | Mouse (mus musculus) | Species |
| **Organism Part** | Brain | Tissue or organ |
| **Condition** | Control | Experimental condition (e.g., untreated vs. disease) |
| **Growth Conditions** | — | How the sample was grown (often blank) |
| **Stabilization** | FFPE | Preservation method (formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded) |

| Field | Example | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Polarity** | Positive | Ion polarity mode |
| **Ionisation Source** | MALDI | Ionization method (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization) |

| **Resolving Power** | at m/z 300.2, 30000 | Resolving power reported at a reference m/z. Shows `at m/z 0, 0` when neither value was provided — the fields default to 0, this is normal. |
| **Matrix** | DHB | Matrix compound (2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid) |
| **Matrix Application** | Spraying | How the matrix was applied |
| **Solvent** | 100% Water | Solvent composition |

## Download

You can download the raw .imzML/.ibd pair in two places.

**Option 1:** Click **Download** on the dataset row in any list view.

![Download from list](https://official-oss.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/docs/20260908170252957.jpg_view)

**Option 2:** Click **Download** on the detail page.

## Share

Both public and private datasets can be shared. Sharing does not change the dataset's visibility.

1. Open the detail page and click **Share**.
2. The link is copied to your clipboard automatically.

The link uses the short `/s/` form built from the dataset's 16-character public id.

## Make Public

To list a dataset under Public Datasets so every user can see it, make it public:

1. Open the detail page from **My Datasets** (the button only appears for private datasets).
2. Click **Make Public** and confirm the dialog.

Making a dataset public cannot be undone. It is independent of sharing: **Share** only copies the link and never turns a private dataset public.

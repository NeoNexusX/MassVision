## Upload a Dataset

Click **Upload New Dataset** to open the upload page.

### 1. Select Files

Click **Choose Files** and select both the `.imzML` and `.ibd` files. They must share the same base filename.

### 2. Visibility

Choose whether the dataset is **public** (visible to all users) or **private** (visible only to you). Public is selected by default.

### 3. Fill in Metadata

Fields marked with \* are required. The spectrum and storage modes are read from the imzML header and pre-filled — changing one asks for confirmation.

## What Happens During Upload

The upload runs entirely in the browser and streams to Alibaba Cloud OSS:

1. A Web Worker hashes the source files with MD5 and asks the server whether the content already exists. A hit reuses the stored copy immediately.
2. On a miss, the client fetches temporary STS credentials and initializes a multipart upload.
3. The pair is compressed to a ZIP64 archive and uploaded part by part while it is still being produced, so the archive is never written to disk.
4. A credit gate, a part queue, and a concurrency governor keep memory bounded and adapt the upload parallelism to the measured bottleneck.
5. Progress, speed, and per-part retry are reported in **Upload Progress**. A part that exhausts its retries stops the pipeline and leaves a resumable session behind.

Interrupted uploads can be resumed from the banner at the top of the upload page. The session is kept in a single `localStorage` entry (`oss_upload_session_v2`) that records the dataset's public id, source filenames, and compression settings, because a resumed part must reproduce the exact same archive bytes. Only one resumable session exists at a time — starting another upload overwrites it. Sessions left by older releases are discarded rather than migrated.

## My Datasets

After uploading, your dataset appears under **Datahub > My Datasets**. See [Dataset Overview](./dataset-overview) for how to view details, download, and share.
